# Web-Components-with-JavaScript-from-HTML-Templates

This is the code for a post I put together on how to Web Components from HTML template tags, but generate them from JavaScript. I couldn't find any clear instructions/tutorials/etc online. So as I figured it out, I put together this code to demonstrate it.

Here's the blog post: https://enomem.io/generating-web-components-with-javascript-from-html-templates/
